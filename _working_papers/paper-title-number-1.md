title: "Maternal Employment Responses to Publicly Funded Full-Day Kindergarten in Arizona"
collection: working_papers
abstract: 'This paper studies the impact on maternal employment of Arizona's expansion of full-day kindergarten between 2004 and 2010. I hypothesize that the expansion of public kindergarten acts as an implicit child care subsidy by reducing the number of hours of paid child care required outside of school. Relying on monthly data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) between 2000 and 2010, this paper uses difference-in-differences and triple differences models that exploit both between state/over time and within state seasonal variation in exposure to Arizona's kindergarten expansion. I find that full-day kindergarten led to an increase in extensive margin employment among mothers with age-eligible children by 2.5 percentage points. However, this increase is heterogeneous and is driven by single and non-white mothers, amounting to increases of 16.7 and 8.2 percentage points, respectively. On the intensive margin, I find a similar pattern of heterogeneous changes in employment. Specifically, weekly hours worked rose by 4.2 hours for single mothers and 1.9 hours for non-white mothers. This subgroup analysis suggests that the benefits of full-day kindergarten expansion were pronounced among populations with pre-existing child care constraints, contributing to a more equitable distribution of labor market gains.'
