title: "Maternal Employment Responses to Publicly Funded Full-Day Kindergarten in Arizona"
collection: working_papers
abstract: ' The paper investigates Arizonaâ€™s full-day kindergarten experiment conducted between 2004 and 2010, during which the state increased public
funding to expand kindergarten from half-day to full-day programs. This expansion implicitly acted as a subsidy for child care, by reducing the number of after-school care hours that were previously required with half-day kindergarten. Using monthly data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) for mothers of age-eligible children across U.S. states from 2000 to 2010, this paper employs a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of full-day kindergarten on ma-
ternal labor supply, considering heterogeneity across race, marital status, age, and education levels.
I find that overall employment among mothers of age-eligible children increased by 2.5 percentage points, driven by significant increases in specific subgroups. Employment increased by 5.8 percentage points for high-skilled mothers, 4.2 percentage points for low-skilled mothers, 16.7 percentage points for single mothers, and 8.2 percentage points for non-White mothers. On the intensive margin, single mothers increased their weekly hours worked by 4.2 hours, and non-White mothers by 1.9 hours. Additionally, I confirm the robustness of these findings using a triple differences estimator. Since U.S. schools typically run from September to May, maternal employment effects of full-day kindergarten are not expected during the summer months. Exploiting this within-year, within-state variation in school attendance, I find a 5.2 percentage point increase in employment among all mothers and a 2.1 hour increase in weekly hours worked. This study provides timely
and relevant insights for state-level policy-making, particularly concerning the potential gains in maternal employment. It contributes to the growing literature on the benefits of full-day kindergarten, suggesting that such programs can play a critical role in supporting working families and enhancing economic stability.'
