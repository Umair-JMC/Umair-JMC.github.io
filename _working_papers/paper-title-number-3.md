title: "Efficacy of technology-aided monitoring for early childhood vaccination coverage: Evidence from a Natural Experiment"
collection: working_papers
abstract: "Achieving population-wide vaccination coverage against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) remains a challenge across the globe. A promising solution involves technology-aided monitoring, which can potentially improve vaccination rates. The current study estimates the impact of a similar intervention on early childhood vaccination rates in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. During late 2014, E-VACCS (an Electronic Vaccine Registration System) was implemented across the province of Punjab, one of the four provinces in Pakistan. We use yearly data (2010-2019) from Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey (PSLM) in a difference-in-differences framework to exploit the natural across-province over-time variation offered to us by Punjab's adoption of E-VACCS. We analyze the impact of E-VACCS on complete vaccination coverage as well as antigen-specific vaccination rates. Treatment effects on vaccination coverage are largely driven by specific sub-populations. The intervention led to a 2.2 percentage points increase in the proportion of children having received at least 1 dose of vaccination. Across urban households, we find a 6.2 percentage points increase in vaccination coverage on the intensive margin. These treatment effects in urban areas are limited to mid-high income households. Our estimates for antigen-specific rates of vaccination coverage confirm similar trends. Among urban mid-high income households, improvements occurred in the antigen-specific coverage rates for vaccines administered towards the end of the childhood vaccination cycle (.e.g D-Tap-3 or Hep-B-3). However for rural low-income households, we find negative treatment effects for antigen-specific vaccine coverage rates, particularly for the three hepatitis doses. The results suggest that the increase in vaccination coverage across urban mid-high income households came at the expense of a significant decrease in coverage across low-income rural households, signaling redirection of critical resources. Our estimates remain robust to several variations in the specifications. Further robustness is also confirmed through event studies."
