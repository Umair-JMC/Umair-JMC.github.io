abstract: 'Immigrants comprise nearly 20% of the child care workforce in the U.S. This paper studies the impact of a
major immigration enforcement policy, Secure Communities (SC), on the structure and functioning of the child
care market. Relying on the staggered introduction of SC across counties between 2008 and 2014, we find that
the program reduced childrenâ€™s participation in center-based child care programs. The estimated reductions are
substantially larger among advantaged children and in jurisdictions with a greater fraction of undocumented
individuals. We also find that SC reduced the equilibrium supply and wages of immigrant and native workers
in the center-based sector as well as the number of center-based facilities. There is no compensating increase
in the home-based or private household sectors. Our findings suggest that immigrants and natives are likely
to be complements in child care service production.'
