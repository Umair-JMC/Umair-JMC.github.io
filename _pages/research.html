My research identity centers on policy analysis using applied microeconometrics and I have a clear and defined research agenda within economics of education, particularly focused but not limited to the market for early childhood education and care. Focusing on the intersections of early education and care, K-12 education, demographics and labor economics, I examine research questions informing contemporary policy issues. In particular, I explore how policy changes related to child care, early education, and K-12 education impact society, and how these changes affect equity across populations. I investigate the differential effects of these changes on various population segments and how socioeconomic events, both exogenous and non-exogenous, shape the policy landscape. Furthermore, I analyze how policy responses to these shocks affect different populations and subpopulations. Lastly, I examine the impacts of demographic changes on social outcomes and how policy instruments can be designed to effectively respond to such changes. </p>

To answer these questions, I rely on rigorous and state-of-the-art microeconometric methods, including various panel data techniques and quasi-experimental approaches. My published and working papers have employed methods such as difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, event studies, and synthetic control methods. Additionally, I have gained extensive experience with randomized controlled trials, matching techniques, and regression discontinuity models during my professional career. In the following paragraphs, I present a summary of my existing research, which will further illustrate my research agenda. </p>

So far, I have three published papers. The first of these papers, co-authored with my primary advisor Chris Herbst as well as well Christos Makridis and published in the Economics of Education Review, examines the impact of Covid-19 related statewide stay-at-home orders (SAHOs) on the supply of early child care and education (ECCE) services. Using exogenous variation from the staggered adoption of SAHOs across states, this paper employs a difference-in-differences framework. We find that online job postings for early care and education teachers declined by 16% after enactment. This
effect is driven exclusively by private-sector services. Indeed, hiring by public programs like Head Start and prekindergarten has not been influenced by SAHOs. We also find that ECE job postings increased dramatically after
SAHOs were lifted, although the number of such postings remains 4% lower than that during the pre-pandemic
period. These findings suggest that SAHOs triggered supply-side changes, potentially leaving households ill-equipped to
insure against the rapid transition to the production of child care. This paper has important implications for child development and parental employment decisions, shedding light on the vulnerabilities of the child care sector during public health crises. </p>

In a second paper, also co-authored with Chris Herbst and Christos Makridis and published in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management (JPAM), we explore the impact of regulations on the child care labor market. Regulations in the child care market are often justified in the context of information frictions between parents and providers, but they can also have unintended consequences for the quantity and quality of services provided. This paper merges data on states’ child care regulations for maximum classroom group sizes and child-to-staff ratios with the universe of online job postings to study the impact of regulations on
the demand for and characteristics of child care labor. Relying
on changes both within states over time and across children’s age groups, the identification strategy in this paper exploits the unprecedented variation in regulatory reform during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings indicate that these regulations reduce the number of child care job postings and encourage providers to substitute away from higher-skilled postings, thereby increasing the number of positions that are out-of-compliance with states’ teacher education requirements.  These results imply that child care regulations may reduce the demand for child care labor while simultaneously altering the composition of the workforce.  From a policy perspective, its imperative to consider that although stringent regulations can potentially enhance child safety as well as the quality of interactions between teachers and children, these benefits might be offset by a reduction in the educational qualifications of teachers. </p>

My third published piece, co-authored with Jessica Brown and Chris Herbst and published in the Journal of Public Economics, examines the impact of the ``Secure Communities'' (SC) immigration enforcement policy on the child care market. Immigrants comprise nearly 20% of the U.S. child care workforce. SC, introduced between 2008 and 2014, allowed ICE to check the immigration status of individuals arrested by local police, leading to numerous arrests and deportations. The paper hypothesizes that "chilling effects" explain changes in the child care market, given that nearly all deported individuals were male and most child care workers are females. The identification strategy for this paper exploits the variation provided by the staggered introduction of SC across U.S. counties to examine the effect of SC enactment on the child care market, in a difference-in-differences framework. Findings indicate that SC reduced formal child care participation as well as the number of child care establishments. Further, SC reduced the equilibrium supply and wages of immigrant and native workers
in the center-based sector. Specifically, it decreased child care participation among three- and four-year-olds by 0.6 percentage points, child care establishments by 1.6%, and child care industry employees by 1.5%. The reductions were more significant in areas with larger Hispanic and undocumented populations. Hourly wages fell by approximately 3%, with a 5% decrease among immigrants and 2% among natives. The findings in this paper have a number of important policy implications. Although the SC program was discontinued in 2014 (for the first time), well over 200,000 individuals continue to be deported each year. As a result, any labor shortages and the consequent chilling effects of a deportation-centric policy remains a key concern for industries that rely on immigrant labor. By reducing the supply of child care, SC further destabilized an already insecure industry. Second, the loss of immigrant child care workers raises concerns about the availability of caregivers who can meet the cultural, linguistic, and developmental needs of immigrant children. </p>

In addition to these published papers, I have a strong pipeline of working papers that I am currently preparing for publication. In my job market paper, I investigate Arizona's full-day kindergarten experiment conducted between 2004 and 2010, during which the state increased public funding to expand kindergarten from half-day to full-day programs. This expansion implicitly acted as a subsidy for child care, by reducing the number of after-school care hours that were previously required with half-day kindergarten. Using monthly data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) for mothers of age-eligible children across U.S. states from 2000 to 2010, this paper employs a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of full-day kindergarten on maternal labor supply, considering heterogeneity across race, marital status, age, and education levels. I find that full-day kindergarten led to an increase in overall employment among mothers by 2.5 percentage points. However, this increase is heterogeneous and driven by certain groups. In particular, the increase is notably high for single mothers and non-White mothers, amounting to 16.7 and 8.2 percentage points, respectively. A similar pattern in estimates on the intensive margin lends further credence to these findings. Among single mothers, weekly hours of work increased by 4.2 hours, and among non-White mothers, weekly hours of work increased by 1.9 hours. Additionally, I confirm the robustness of these findings using a triple differences estimator. Since U.S. schools typically run from September to May, maternal employment effects of full-day kindergarten are not expected during the summer months. Exploiting this within-year, within-state variation in school attendance, I find a 5.2 percentage point increase in employment among all mothers and a 2.1 hour increase in weekly hours of work. This study provides timely and relevant insights for state-level policy-making, particularly concerning the potential gains in maternal employment. It contributes to the growing literature on the benefits of full-day kindergarten, suggesting that such programs can play a critical role in supporting working families and enhancing economic stability. </p>

Another working paper examines the demographic shifts within K-12 education due to immigration. Over the past few decades, the U.S. has
received an increasing number of immigrants into the nation. In the context of immigration, the theory of
native flight argues that U.S. born populations move away from neighborhoods with higher numbers of
immigrant settlers. Merging school level data with the U.S. census data over the years 2005-2019, I use an
instrumental variable approach to examine the impact of immigration on native flight. The findings reveal that a one percent increase in the share of immigrants in the population leads to significant shifts in the demographic composition of both public and private schools. In public schools, this increase corresponds to a 0.55 percent decline in the share of White enrollment and a 0.76 percent decline in the share of Black enrollment. Conversely, the share of Hispanic enrollment rises by 0.48 percent, and the share of Asian enrollment increases by 0.57 percent. In private schools, the same one percent increase in the immigrant population results in a 1.35 percent increase in the share of White enrollment, while the share of Black enrollment decreases by 0.72 percent. To summarize, these estimates confirm the theory of native flight from public schools. However, as expected, native flight is not homogeneous across U.S. born race/ ethnicities. These findings confirm that immigration poses unique challenges relating to diversity, inclusion and cohesion in education systems, including K-12 education. Augmented with a robust estimation strategy, this paper provides a new, fresh look at the existing evidence on the impacts of immigration on enrollment changes within the K-12 school system.</p>

My future research will further investigate the intersections of early education and care, K-12 education, demographics and labor economics. Besides the working papers describe above, I am conceptualizing two papers that demonstrate my dedication to expanding this research agenda. The first paper builds upon my research on Arizona's kindergarten expansion, specifically investigating the long-term academic outcomes associated with participation in full-day kindergarten compared to half-day kindergarten. Using state-specific NAEP test scores, I intend to analyze cohorts of students exposed to full-day kindergarten during Arizona's initiative. This study aims to deepen our understanding of how educational policy interventions, like full-day kindergarten programs, influence academic achievement and educational equity over time. </p>

The second paper focuses on exploring the impact of low-skilled immigration on parental time-use, particularly in the context of child care. Given that child care is a sector with significant employment of low-skilled immigrants, variations in low-skilled immigration are likely to affect the production and availability of child care services. This research aims to examine how changes in low-skilled immigration patterns influence parental time allocation towards child care. Leveraging datasets such as The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and the American Community Survey (ACS), I will analyze how households adjust their parental time-use in response to shifts in low-skilled immigration. Understanding how immigration policies affect parental time-use can provide critical insights for policymakers regarding necessary adjustments in child care policies, such as subsidies or regulations. Moreover, this research will contribute valuable evidence to inform immigration policies aimed at addressing broader societal impacts on family dynamics and child care provision. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
In summary, my research will continue to investigate how different policy interventions, such as child care subsidies and parental leave policies, impact family well-being and economic stability. Through rigorous quantitative methods and a focus on the interactions between education, child care, and demographics, my goal is to contribute to evidence-based policy development that promotes equitable and sustainable outcomes for children and families.
