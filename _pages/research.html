My research concentrates on the economics of education, with a focus on early childhood education. I explore research questions informing contemporary policy issues at the intersection of early childhood education and care, K-12 education, demographics, and labor economics. Specifically, I examine how shifts in policy and demographic changes impact education markets, exploring dimensions such as access to and quality of services. Additionally, I analyze the ways in which socioeconomic events—whether exogenous or endogenous—reshape the policy landscape. Much of my work focuses on the differential effects of these changes across population subgroups, aiming to inform policies that enhance both the access and quality of education for all segments of society.</p>

To address these research questions, I employ rigorous and state-of-the-art microeconometric methods, including various panel data techniques and quasi-experimental approaches. My published and working papers have utilized methods such as difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, event studies, and synthetic control models. Additionally, I have gained extensive experience with randomized controlled trials, matching techniques, and regression discontinuity models during my professional career. In the following paragraphs, I summarize my current research and outline my research agenda for the coming years.</p>

  So far, I have three published papers. The first of these papers---co-authored with my primary advisor Chris Herbst as well as Christos Makridis and published in the \<i>Economics of Education Review </i>---examines the impact of Covid-19 related statewide stay-at-home orders (SAHOs) on the supply of early child care and education (ECCE) services. Using plausibly exogenous variation in the staggered adoption of SAHOs across states, this paper uses a difference-in-differences design, finding that online job postings for early care and education teachers declined by 16\% after enactment. This effect is driven exclusively by private-sector services. Indeed, hiring by public programs like Head Start and pre-kindergarten was not influenced by SAHOs. We also find that ECCE job postings increased dramatically after SAHOs were lifted, although the number of such postings remained 4\% lower than that during the pre-pandemic period. These findings suggest that SAHOs triggered supply-side changes, potentially leaving households ill-equipped to insure against the rapid transition to the production of child care. This paper has important implications for child development and parental employment decisions, shedding light on the vulnerabilities of the child care sector during public health crises.

In a second paper, also co-authored with Chris Herbst and Christos Makridis and published in the <i>Journal of Policy Analysis and Management</i>, we explore the impact of minimum quality regulations on the demand for child care labor. This paper merges data on states’ child care regulations for maximum classroom group sizes and child-to-staff ratios with the universe of online job postings, and relies on policy variation both within states over time and across children’s age groups for identification. The findings indicate that regulations reduce the number of child care job postings and encourage providers to substitute away from higher-skilled postings, thereby increasing the number of positions that are out-of-compliance with states’ teacher education requirements. These results imply that child care regulations may reduce the demand for child care labor while simultaneously altering the composition of the workforce. From a policy perspective, it is imperative to consider that while tougher regulations can potentially enhance child safety as well as overall service quality, these benefits might be offset by a reduction in the educational qualifications of teachers.

My third published piece, co-authored with Jessica Brown and Chris Herbst and published in the <i>Journal of Public Economics</i>, examines the impact of the ``Secure Communities'' (SC) immigration enforcement policy on the child care market. Immigrants comprise nearly 20\% of the U.S. child care workforce. SC, introduced between 2008 and 2014, allowed ICE to check the immigration status of individuals arrested by local police, leading to numerous arrests and deportations and possibly a ``chilling effect'' on immigrants' behavior. The identification strategy for this paper exploits the staggered introduction of SC across U.S. counties to examine the effect of SC enactment on the child care market in a difference-in-differences framework. Findings indicate that SC reduced formal child care participation as well as the equilibrium supply and wages of immigrant and native workers in the center-based sector. The findings in this paper have a number of important policy implications. Although the SC program was discontinued in 2014 (for the first time), well over 200,000 individuals continue to be deported each year. As a result, any labor shortages and the consequent chilling effects of a deportation-centric policy remain a key concern for industries that rely on immigrant labor.</p>

In addition to these published papers, I have a strong pipeline of working papers that I am currently preparing for publication. My job market paper examines the impact on maternal employment of Arizona's expansion of full-day kindergarten between 2004 and 2010. I hypothesize that the expansion of public kindergarten acts as an implicit child care subsidy by reducing the number of hours of paid child care required outside of school. Relying on monthly data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) between 2000 and 2010, this paper uses difference-in-differences and triple differences models that exploit both between state/over time and within state seasonal variation in exposure to Arizona's kindergarten expansion. I find that full-day kindergarten led to an increase in extensive margin employment among mothers with age-eligible children by 2.5 percentage points. However, this increase is heterogeneous and is driven by single and non-white mothers, amounting to increases of 16.7 and 8.2 percentage points, respectively. On the intensive margin, I find a similar pattern of heterogeneous changes in employment. Specifically, weekly hours worked rose by 4.2 hours for single mothers and 1.9 hours for non-white mothers. This subgroup analysis suggests that the benefits of full-day kindergarten expansion were pronounced among populations with pre-existing child care constraints, contributing to a more equitable distribution of labor market gains. These findings provide timely insights for state-level policy-making, particularly regarding the potential employment benefits for mothers. Additionally, this study contributes to the broader literature on the benefits of full-day kindergarten by demonstrating its role in supporting working families and mothers.</p>

Another working paper examines the demographic shifts within K-12 education due to immigration. Over the past few decades, the U.S. has received an increasing number of immigrants. As a result, the theory of native flight has gained attention, which argues that U.S.-born populations move away from neighborhoods with higher numbers of immigrant settlers. Merging school-level data with the U.S. Census data over the years 2005-2019, I use an instrumental variable approach to examine the impact of immigration on native flight. The findings reveal that a 1 percent increase in the share of immigrants in the population leads to significant shifts in the demographic composition of both public and private schools. In public schools, this increase corresponds to a 0.55 percent decline in the share of White enrollment and a 0.76 percent decline in the share of Black enrollment. Conversely, the share of Hispanic enrollment rises by 0.48 percent, and the share of Asian enrollment increases by 0.57 percent. In private schools, the same 1 percent increase in the immigrant population results in a 1.35 percent increase in the share of White enrollment, while the share of Black enrollment decreases by 0.72 percent. Confirming the theory of native flight from public schools, these findings show that immigration poses unique challenges relating to diversity, inclusion and cohesion in education systems, including K-12 education. They suggest that policymakers and educators need to address these demographic shifts to foster more equitable and inclusive educational environments.</p>

Building on my current body of work, my future research will continue to explore the intersections of early education and care, K-12 education, demographics and labor economics. In addition to the working papers described above, I am conceptualizing two new papers that will extend this agenda. The first paper builds upon my research on Arizona's kindergarten expansion, specifically investigating the long-term academic outcomes associated with participation in full-day kindergarten compared to half-day kindergarten. Using state-level NAEP test scores, I intend to analyze cohorts of students exposed to full-day kindergarten in Arizona between 2004 and 2010. This study aims to deepen our understanding of how educational policy interventions, like full-day kindergarten programs, influence academic achievement and educational equity over time. </p>

The second paper focuses on exploring the impact of low-skilled immigration on parental time-use, particularly in the context of child care. Given that child care is a sector with significant employment of low-skilled immigrants, variations in low-skilled immigration are likely to affect the production and availability of child care services. This research aims to examine how changes in low-skilled immigration patterns influence parental time allocation toward child care. Leveraging datasets such as The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and the American Community Survey (ACS), I will analyze how households adjust their time-allocation toward child care in response to shifts in low-skilled immigration. Understanding how immigration policies affect parental time-use can provide critical insights for policymakers regarding necessary adjustments in child care policies, such as subsidies or regulations. Moreover, this research will contribute valuable evidence to inform immigration policies aimed at addressing broader societal impacts on family dynamics and child care provision. </p>

In the coming years, I will continue to focus on the intersections of early childhood education and care, K-12 education, and demographics. For example, I plan to study the impact of demographic shifts on workforce characteristics, including diversity and inclusion, and investigate how these characteristics translate into student achievement. I am also interested in explaining how regulations in early education and care impact parental and family involvement, aiming to understand their broader implications for educational outcomes and family dynamics. In summary, I am committed to producing policy-relevant research of contemporaneous relevance, with an aim to contribute to evidence-based policy development that promotes equitable and sustainable outcomes for children and families.
