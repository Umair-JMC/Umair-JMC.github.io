<p>I am a candidate on the academic job market for positions in Public Policy and Public Administration for the 2025 academic year. I am a dedicated researcher and educator in the field of public policy, with a strong focus on the economics of education and the market for early childhood education and care. I earned my PhD in Public Administration & Policy from the School of Public Affairs at Arizona State University in 2022, where I concentrated on education policy, labor economics, and research methods. My career has been driven by a commitment to producing policy-informing research of contemporary relevance, intricately tied to the changing socioeconomic and demographic landscape.</p>

<p>My research has been published in high-quality public policy and economics journals, including the Economics of Education Review, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, and Journal of Public Economics. My published papers address critical issues such as the impact of COVID-19 related statewide stay-at-home orders on early child care and education services, the effects of child care regulations on the labor market, and the consequences of immigration enforcement policies on the child care market.</p>

<p>I held a Fulbright Scholarship for my PhD and was obligated to spend 2 years in my home country. To fulfil this commitment, I have been working with the Center for Evaluation and Development (C4ED) as an impact evaluation specialist since completing my PhD. In this role, I have conducted experimental and quasi-experimental research across a range of national and international development projects. My work at C4ED has enabled me to apply my research skills in experimental and non-experimental research, producing insights that are both academically rigorous and practically impactful.</p>

<p>Besides these published papers, I have a few working papers and new research projects that further explore the intersections of education, child care, and demographics. My future research aims to investigate the long-term academic outcomes of full-day kindergarten programs and the impact of low-skilled immigration on parental time-use, particularly in the context of child care.</p>

<p>In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching. I have successfully instructed undergraduate courses in economics for public policy analysis and applied statistics, receiving positive feedback from both peers and students. My teaching philosophy is centered on inspiring and motivating students through interactive and engaging learning experiences, connecting classroom concepts with real-world applicability, and aligning my curriculum with current academic standards and global educational benchmarks.</p>

<p>I aspire to secure a position that enables me to continue conducting high-impact research that informs policy development and advances equitable and sustainable outcomes for children and families.</p>
