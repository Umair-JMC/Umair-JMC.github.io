<p>I am seeking academic positions in Public Policy and Public Administration for the 2025 academic year. I am a dedicated researcher and educator in the field of public policy, with a strong focus on the economics of education and the market for early childhood education and care. I earned my PhD in Public Administration & Policy from the School of Public Affairs at Arizona State University in 2022, where I concentrated on education policy, labor economics, and research methods. My career has been driven by a commitment to producing policy-informing research of contemporary relevance, intricately tied to the changing socioeconomic and demographic landscape.</p>

<p>My research has been published in leading public policy and economics journals, including the Economics of Education Review, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, and Journal of Public Economics. My published papers address critical issues such as the impact of COVID-19-related statewide stay-at-home orders on early child care and education services, the effects of child care regulations on the labor market, and the consequences of immigration enforcement policies on the child care market.</p>

<p>Besides these published papers, I am working on several papers and new research projects that further explore the intersections of education, child care, and demographics. Two of my papers, currently in the conceptualization stage, focus on the long-term academic outcomes of full-day kindergarten programs in Arizona and the impact of low-skilled immigration on parental time allocation for child care. These studies aim to deepen our understanding of how educational and immigration policies affect academic achievement, educational equity, and family dynamics. In the coming years, I will continue to focus on the intersections of early childhood education and care, K-12 education, and demographics. For example, I plan to study the impact of demographic shifts on workforce characteristics, including diversity and inclusion, and investigate how these characteristics translate into student achievement. I am also interested in explaining how regulations in early education and care impact parental and family involvement, aiming to understand their broader implications for educational outcomes and family dynamics. In summary, I am committed to producing policy-relevant research of contemporaneous relevance, with an aim to contribute to evidence-based policy development that promotes equitable and sustainable outcomes for children and families.</p>

<p>In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching. I have successfully instructed undergraduate courses in economics for public policy analysis and applied statistics, receiving positive feedback from both peers and students. My teaching philosophy centers on inspiring and motivating students through interactive and engaging learning experiences, connecting classroom concepts with real-world applicability, and aligning my curriculum with current academic standards and global educational benchmarks.</p>

<p>Since finishing my PhD, I have been working in Pakistan to fulfill a requirement of my Fulbright Scholarship, which I received to facilitate my doctoral studies in the U.S. I am currently employed at the Center for Evaluation and Development (C4ED) as an impact evaluation specialist, designing and implementing experimental and quasi-experimental evaluations of education, health, and employment projects across a range of national and international development settings. My work at C4ED has enabled me to apply my research skills in experimental and non-experimental research, producing insights that are both academically rigorous and practically impactful.</p>

<p>I now aspire to secure an academic position where I can continue conducting high-impact research that informs policy development and promotes equitable, sustainable outcomes for children and families.</p>
